There's no `.env` file set up yet. The server requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to run.

Would you like to:
1. Create a `.env` file with your GitHub token, then run `npm start`
2. Run anyway (it may fail without the token)

What's your GitHub token, or would you like me to just run it and see what happens?
